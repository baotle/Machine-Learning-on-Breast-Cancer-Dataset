# Machine-Learning-on-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
This repository and its related code were used to train a model that is capable of classifying benign and malignant breast cancer with PyTorch. The dataset is based on the open dataset "Breast Cancer Wisconsin". The primary aim of this project was for the author to practice and show his ML / AI skills especially with PyTorch.
